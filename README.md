# Automatic-Room-Lighting-System
The Automatic Room Lighting System is a microcontroller-based project that turns on and off lights in a room automatically. 
Electricity, as one of the most valuable resources, must be used with caution. In today's digital world, we can employ many technologies to execute specific jobs automatically.
The project presented here is an example of this type of project, in which a microcontroller-based system controls the room lights automatically.
