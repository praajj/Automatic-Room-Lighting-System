# Automatic-Room-Lighting-System
The Automatic Room Lighting System is a microcontroller-based project that turns on and off lights in a room automatically. 
Electricity, as one of the most valuable resources, must be used with caution. In today's digital world, we can employ many technologies to execute specific jobs automatically.
The project presented here is an example of this type of project, in which a microcontroller-based system controls the room lights automatically.
The goal of this project is to detect human movement and automatically turn on or off the lights in a room. 
We used an 8051 microcontroller, LEDâ€™s and two infrared (IR) sensors to complete this project.
The circuit's job is to turn on the light when someone enters the room and turn off the light when the last person leaves. As a result, the project performs the function of an Automatic Room Lighting System.
